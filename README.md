# Projet : Oxono 

## Description : 

The Oxono project, developed as part of our studies, taught us how to design and implement software using the **MVC architecture** along with key design patterns such as **Observer and Command** with javaFX.

## Features :

- **MVC architecture** for clean separation of concerns
